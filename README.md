# Web-based-ChatBot-using-Chatterbot


ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of known conversations. The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it to be trained to speak any language. In this lesson, we will learn how to make a User Interface (UI) chatbot using the ChatterBot in the flask framework.


Lesson Goals
In this lesson, we will learn how to make a User Interface (UI) chatbot using the ChatterBot in the flask framework. This is new-age technological advancements in the artificial intelligence and machine learning domain.
Prerequests
pip install Flask
pip install chatterbot
pip install chatterbot-corpus
pip install Spacy
Pip install Numpy
Make sure to create a new directory and new environment
ChatterBot
ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a user’s input. Chatterbot uses machine learning algorithms to predict the responses to the user’s inputs.



Create an app.py file and open it in your text editor. After creating the file, now we will start writing our python code in the app.py file. First of all, we need to import the required libraries in our project.

Project initiation
create projet directory ---i use botworkshop
create python environmental variable and activate it
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate --- then install all libraries mentioned above in this environment.
create folder by the name "templete" --- we will use it to store our html file and css
creat python script file ---- i use insulin.py.
Since we are running this python script from the command line we need to writing our python code in the insulin.py file.
Use Case – Flask ChatterBot
Following is the code for the flask ChatterBot app.
